### HOW IT WORKS 

#### Copy Tree
###### Make a copy of the tree structure, no files will be copied, just directories.

#### Copy Files 
###### Make a full copy from the source to the destination. Files and directory will be copied.

#### Copy Newer Files
###### Make a copy of new items and edited files only. Files and directories allready present won't be copied.

#### Copy Only Edited Files
###### Make a copy of files edited only. New directories or files not edited won't be copied.

#### Move Files
###### Move all items from source to destination.

#### Wipe Out Destination
###### Erase all items present in the source selected. A window will be displayed indicating a number of files that are being used during the process if it's the case.

#### Create Paths List
###### Make a txt file containing every paths from the source.
