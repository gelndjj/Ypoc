## HOW IT WORKS 

### Copy Tree
###### Make a copy of the tree structure, no files will be copied, just directories.

### Copy Files 
###### Make a full copy from source to destination. Files and directory will be copied.

### Copy Files as ZIP
###### Make a full copy from source to destination then compress as ZIP File.

### Copy Newer Files
###### Make a copy of new items and edited files only. Files and directories allready present won't be copied.

### Copy Only Edited Files
###### Make a copy of edited files only. New directories or files not edited won't be copied.

### Move Files
###### Move all items from source to destination.

### Wipe Out Destination
###### Erase all items present in the selected source. A window will be displayed indicating a number of files that are being used during the process if it's the case.

### Create Paths List
###### Make a txt file containing every paths from the source.

### _Percent Copy Progress_
###### While copying or moving data, a red label displays the copy progress. Pressing "a" abort the copy.
